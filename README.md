# Weather-React-app
A simple weather application/website built with React

In order to use this application/website and test it by yourself, you should replace the Api Key in the script.js file (here: https://github.com/Amihai-bl13/Weather-React-app/blob/52e8be4b6c43c87d556c945daf9e39e73401f7d1/script.js#L32C11-L32C11) with your Api key
(you can create a new one for yourself (for free) here: https://home.openweathermap.org/), since the provided key is inactive. 

Notice: you should wait a couple of hours after creating the key, since it can take a while to be approved.
